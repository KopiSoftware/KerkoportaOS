# KerkoportaOS
Follow the book '30 days to make operation system' and create my system.
This program compiles in the Windows environment.


USER GUIDE
Unpack the package and make sure that two directories are in the same path.
Enter KerkoportaOS and open the file '!cons_nt.bat' and then you will see a 
console.The path of the console is already settled in the same directory of
the program.Now input 'make img' and press enter, the complier will generat
a series of files including the image file 'haribote.img'(Okay, this name 
is just for now.I will change it as soon as possible).Then the compiling is 
done.

Open your VMWare and create a new virtual machine.The operate system option
 should be set as 'other system'.Then create a floppy input,push the image 
 file(haribote.img) in and start the virtual mathine.You will see the operat
 ing system.
